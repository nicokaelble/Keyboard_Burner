# Keyboard_Burner

Keyboard Burner is a website project that was made to improve the users typing speed by typing funny and famous quotes.

The website was developed as part of a coursework for the module Advanced Web Technology at the Edinburgh Napier University.

According to the coursework specifications this website was developed under the topic "Online Education Technologies" and with the use of the micro web framework flask.

It also is my first website project, so if you dicover any bugs or you have any suggestions for improvement please send me a mail at nicokaelble@gmail.com :)
